The theme of this thesis is ``Human hand detection on video''.

The purpose of this thesis is to implement and analyze 3 approaches of human hand localization in video stream. In the thesis were realized the following methods: background subtraction, color filter based on Bayes classifier and processing the video stream from depth camera.

Thesis results:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 3 methods of human hand localization in video stream were implemented;
	\item for each method were analyzed the optimal working conditions;
	\item proposed a convenient way for Bayes classifier training;
	\item made a comparison of methods.
\end{itemize}

Current thesis results are proposed for using in computer-human interaction systems. In further researches it is reasonable to create a computer-human interaction system based on realized approaches and gesture recognition with support vector machine or neural networks.
